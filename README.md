# Electronic Notice Board

## Overview

This project is a simple web-based Electronic Notice Board designed to allow users to post and view announcements. The current version is built primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. 

## Project Status

Initially, I attempted to implement PHP for server-side processing, particularly for handling forms and managing user data. However, I plan to transition to using Java with Spring Boot to enhance the security features of the application, particularly for the login and signup functionalities.

## Upcoming Features

- **Login and Signup Security:** I intend to replace the current PHP-based authentication with a more robust solution using Spring Boot. This will provide better security for user credentials and ensure data integrity.

- **Admin Dashboard:** An admin panel will be developed, allowing administrators to manage announcements, view user activity, and monitor the systemâ€™s performance. The dashboard will offer various controls and analytics to ensure effective management of the notice board.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP (to be replaced with Java Spring Boot)
- **Database:** MySQL (planned integration with Spring Boot)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/rushinga/electronic-notice-board.git
   

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   
   cd electronic-notice-board


3. **Start the PHP server (current implementation):**

   php -S localhost:8000


4. **Access the application:**
   Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Future Plans

- **Spring Boot Integration:** Implementing Spring Boot for the backend to handle login, signup, and user session management.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Establishing user roles (admin, user) for more granular access control.
- **Improved User Experience:** Enhancing the UI and UX to make the notice board more interactive and user-friendly.
